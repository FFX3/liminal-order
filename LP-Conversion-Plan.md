We're going to use double entry bookkeeping techniques.

# LP Collection

Liminal order will collect 100% of all members LP (For the moment this will mean corp members should use another toon to do mission, unless we have a program for that specific LP Store)

We'll use the EvE Esi to track how many victory points each pilot got to determine future payouts, this is imperfect but should be a good enough proxy

# Strategic Resource Division - Transfer start

Will then come up with a plan to spend a specific amount of LP, this plan will be validated by Liminal Order who will then transfer the exact amount of LP requested. This creates a Equity account denominated in LP in Strategic Resource Division's books. A batch ID will be used later to link this LP payout to each individual corporation member.

LP conversion requires ISK funds, these funds can come from Liminal Order, Strategic Resource Division, or non-corp related entities since the burden of trust is on the external party our alliance is at no financial risk. Deposits from liquidity providers will create a Equity account for each investor. These investors will get a 2% (subject to negotiation) return on all funds debited from their accounts (investor accounts will be used proportionally). Unused equity will simply be refunded to the investor.

# Strategic Resource Division - Bought items

Some LP items requires 'real assets' (modules, charges, etc.) inputs. Buy orders may be placed and marked with a batch ID.

Standard shiping rates will be applied when moving asset, this allows us to compensate future haulers fairly and allows us to use services like Red Frog.

# Strategic Resource Division - Selling Modules

Some items might be required for Liminal Order Stockpiles. Liminal order will get priority along with a discount of 10% (subject to change). Avoiding market fees will allow us to provide ship replacement programs, pay for corporate offices, and maintain a stockpile of weapons in FW space.

Items not bought by Liminal Order will go on to the market as Strategic Resource Division sees fit. Once all the items from the batch are sold ISK will be sent back to Liminal which will clear out the LP denomitated Equity account from the first step. At this point we'll know what the LP to ISk ratio is.

Strategic Resource Division will then get to keep 5% as a base and 15% of any funds that brings the LP conversion ratio passed 2500isk/lp (subject to change). This bring insentive for Strategic Resource Division to maximize returns on conversions.

# Liminal Order - Fund distributions

Once Liminal Order receives the isk for a given batch from Strategic Resource Division it redistributes the isk based on Victory points gained during that batch period as discused in the "Transfer start" section. At this point Liminal Order can decide if it wants to further tax the Isk to fund it's programs.
